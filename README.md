# Bithacks-Competition
The AI-for-social-change hackathon.

## Ideas:
### Brain Tumour Detector
We could make a image classifier that tries to detect brain tumours from a segmented MRI scan.

**`Pros`:**
 *    If it works, this could be a very useful and valuable tool for radiologists.
 *    There are brain tumour datasets that we could use to train our model.
 
**`Cons`:**
 *    I'm not sure how applicable this is to the 'social change' aspect. Though 'social change' is purposefully ambiguous, so who knows?
 *    As with most things in a medical application - it needs to be consistent, and I think this will be hard to achieve.
 
### Self-diagnosis Chatbot
We could make a chatbot website, in which the user describes their symptoms to the chatbot, and a model tries to determine what illness they have.

**`Pros`:**
 *    There are plenty of simple tutorials for the constituent parts of this project. We could use these as a starting point.
 *    There are a few datasets that could be used for this project.
 
**`Cons`:**
 *    Just like the 'Brain Tumour Detector' the medical obligation to make the model consistent is present.
 *    We will need to think about hosting the website, I (Guillaume) would be happy to do this, but it would cost some money.
  
### Diet Advice Chatbot
We could make a chatbot website, in which the user describes their eating habits and typical meals to the chatbot, and a model determines what is missing from the person's diet and then it offers some dietary advice.

**`Pros`:**
 *    Obesity, etc. are all important social issues at the moment.
 *    There are a surprising number of nutrition datasets.
 
**`Cons`:**
 *    Just like the 'Self-diagnosis Chatbot', we will need to host the chatbot somehow.
 *    Unlike the 'Self-diagnosis Chatbot', there are a wider variety of foods that are eaten by the average person, than common symptoms experienced by someone with an illness. Therefore, it could be a significant challenge to find the nutritional information of the foods that are commonly eaten.
 
## ToDo:
- [ ] Decide which project to do.
- [ ] We'll cross this bridge when we come to it.
